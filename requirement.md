# The project focuses on creating a web application (inspired by the real Aspire application) divided in 2 sections:

1. CSS Challenge:

The candidate should convert the designs into an application with a focus on design fidelity and usage of libraries and tools aligned with the Code Challenge use Tailwind.

2. Code Challenge:

The task is to make the UI built with the CSS challenge dynamic and interactive. General notes:
1. Application can be built with any tools/libraries (if needed)
2. Application should use an API architecture, where dummy data can be returned from the APIs directly within the code, no real server-side code is required
3. The data can be stored in localStorage or state management systems
4. At the start up of the application, some cards should be already available

# Interactions:
 ## Add new card:
  1.1 Open a modal where the user can add the card name and submit it. The expiration date and card number will be randomly generated by the system.
  1.2 The card will be appended in the carousel together with the other cards 

 ## Freeze/Unfreeze card
  2.1 On click of the freeze card, the card will get the frozen status
  2.2 The frozen card will look different from the others (up to the candidate for the look of it can be a simple semi-transparent opacity value applied)
  2.3 The freeze button will toggle to “unfreeze” for the frozen card

# Must have
 1. Use of TypeScript, with appropriate types/interfaces
 2. Use of a modern JS framework/libraries (Vue.js/React/Angular/Svelte/Alpine etc.)
 3. Desktop resolution CSS challenge
 4. Pixel perfect version of the CSS challenge
 5. Code optimized for high performance
 6. Simple and consistent code style, following best practices
 7. A README.md containing all the information that the reviewers need to run and use the app
